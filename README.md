## Course Objectives[[1]](https://se.ieu.edu.tr/en/syllabus/type/read/id/SE+375)
The goal of this course is to _extend_ students’ knowledge in **systems programming** by focusing on **practical network** and **multi threaded programming**. Topics such as **communication protocols**, **synchronization primitives**, **deadlocks**, **information security**, **authentication**, **confidentiality**, **integrity** and **digital signing** are _introduced_ in this course. The _Java programming language_ will be used throughout the course. All laboratory exercises and assignments will be performed in Java; therefore, to be able to complete this course, _a student should have good programming skills in Java_.

## Learning Outcomes[[1]](https://se.ieu.edu.tr/en/syllabus/type/read/id/SE+375)
- _The students who succeeded in this course_;
  - be able to _explain_ **threading concepts** and the **advantages and potential problems of threaded programming**,
  - be able to _design_ **experiments** to _illustrate_ **advantages obtained from threaded programs**,
  - be able to _explain_ the **key principles of computer networks and their operation principles and protocols**,
  - be able to _implement_ **socket programming and multi-threaded networking program**,
  - be able to _apply_ **security concepts of authentication, confidentiality, integrity and digital signing**.

## Inspiration
Software Engineering 375 (SE 375) LAB Instructions (Izmir University of Economics, 2024, SE 375 course, Spring Semester laboratory tasks)
  
As a student of the Izmir University of Economics, I made these tasks in accordance with the SE 375 laboratory tasks instructions for the spring semester laboratory tasks of the SE 375 course in 2024.
  
The repo conforms almost exactly to the document. It is highly personalized.
  
I share documents publicly. The contents of the SE 375 projects that will be given in the future may be similar to this document. If you have an ethical responsibility based on this or a similar course, assignment, or task, please use this as an opinion only. If you have a question or need more information about the solutions, send an email to me: <ejderaysunn@gmail.com>
